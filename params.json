{"name":"Angular-charlimit","tagline":"Angularjs Directive to limit the number of characters allowed in a text field","body":"### Angular Character Limit\r\n\r\nThis is my directive to limit the number of characters you can enter in a text field. It assumes you are using Bootstrap, and appends the warning class to your ```control-group``` at 10 characters left, and ```error``` at 0.\r\n\r\n#### Use\r\n\r\nYou need to include the ```igCharLimit.js``` file before your app, but after angular.\r\n\r\nThis directive creates a new html attribute called char-limit. On your ```<input />``` or ```<textarea></textarea>``` you put ```char-limit=\"x\"```, where x is the number of characters you wish to limit the field to.\r\n\r\nFor exampleâ€¦\r\n\r\n\t// Load the directive\r\n\t<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script src=\"angular.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script src=\"igCharLimit.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script src=\"ngApp.js\"></script>\r\n\t\r\n\t// In your controller\r\n\t// Include the module in your app\r\n\tvar ngMyApp = angular.module('myApp', ['igTypahead']);\r\n\t\r\n\t// In your markup\r\n\t<textarea ng-model=\"message\" char-limit=\"10\"></textarea>\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Angularjs (Tested against 1.0.1 and later*)\r\n* jQuery\r\n* Bootstrap (This directive assumes you are using it, and assigns the warning, and error classes to your elemenets control-group div, but does not need Bootstrap to function.)\r\n\r\n#### Todo\r\n\r\n* Remove dependency on jQuery\r\n* Remove assumption on Bootstrap","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
